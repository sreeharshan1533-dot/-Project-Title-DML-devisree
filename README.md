Project Title

Double Machine Learning Project Using Python

Project Description

This project implements Double Machine Learning for causal inference using Python.
The main objective of the project is to estimate the Average Treatment Effect using a residualization based machine learning approach.
The project is developed for academic learning purposes.

File Information

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named DML_Devisree.ipynb.
The notebook includes data generation code, model implementation, and output results.
